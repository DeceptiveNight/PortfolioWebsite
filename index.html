                        Hi there! I'm David, the greatest programmer in humankind. 
                        Over my programming career, I have created countless programs that have changed the course of humanity.
                        In my spare time, I like to go outside and try all the delicious food my city of Santa Ana has to offer. I also hit the gym 6 days a week to keep myself ripped and healthy!
                        All jokes, aside, I'm a senior currently attending Cal state Fullerton. My goal is to find a full stack engineering job by the end of next year. That's why i've been doing the full stack engineer course at codecademy!
